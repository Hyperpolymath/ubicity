- **Issues Triage**: Triage new issues within 3 days
- **Community**: Participate in discussions, help newcomers
- **Philosophy**: Preserve and advocate for UbiCity values

## Maintainer Responsibilities

### Code Review

- Review pull requests promptly (within 7 days)
- Provide constructive, educational feedback
- Ensure code meets quality standards (tests, docs, types)
- Verify philosophy alignment (tools not platforms, data first, etc.)

### Issue Triage

- Close duplicates or off-topic issues respectfully
- Identify high-priority bugs
- Help refine feature requests

### Release Management

- Follow semantic versioning
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Tag releases in git
- Write release notes
- Monitor for critical bugs post-release

### Community

- Welcome new contributors
- Enforce Code of Conduct
- Facilitate discussions

## Governance

### Decision-Making

**Consensus-Based**: Maintainers seek consensus on significant decisions.

**Types of Decisions**:

| Decision Type | Process |
|---------------|---------|
| Minor bug fix | Any maintainer can merge |
| Feature addition | 2+ maintainer approval |
| Breaking change | All maintainer consensus |
| Philosophy change | Community discussion + consensus |
| New maintainer | All maintainer approval |

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Discussion**: Try to reach consensus through discussion
2. **Mediation**: If stuck, bring in neutral third party
3. **Vote**: As last resort, simple majority (with tie-breaker by project lead)
4. **Transparency**: Document decision rationale publicly

### Communication Channels

- **Public**: GitHub Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests
- **Private**: maintainers@ubicity.example.org (for CoC issues, security, personnel)
- **Urgent**: Signal group (for maintainers only)

## Stepping Down

Maintainers may step down at any time:

1. **Notice**: Give 2 weeks notice if possible (not required)
2. **Handoff**: Transfer ongoing work to other maintainers
3. **Access**: Repository access will be revoked
4. **Emeritus**: Move to Emeritus Maintainers section (with consent)
5. **Recognition**: Contributions remain in git history

Stepping down is **not a failure**. We recognize that priorities change.

## Removal

In rare cases, maintainers may be removed for:

- **Inactivity**: No activity for 6+ months without notice
- **CoC Violation**: Serious or repeated Code of Conduct violations
- **Philosophy Divergence**: Actively working against project values

**Process**:
1. Private discussion among other maintainers
2. Attempt to resolve the issue
3. If unresolvable, unanimous decision (excluding the maintainer in question)
4. Private notification with reasoning
5. Public announcement (if appropriate)

## Current Focus Areas

### Areas Needing Maintainers

1. **ReScript Expert**: Focus on `src-rescript/` optimization
2. **WASM/Rust**: Focus on `wasm/` performance
3. **Documentation**: Improve guides, tutorials, API docs
4. **Community**: Manage discussions, welcome newcomers
5. **Testing**: Expand test coverage, add benchmarks

Even if you're not ready to be a maintainer, you can:

- Review pull requests (anyone can comment!)
- Answer questions in Discussions
- Improve documentation
- Write tutorials or blog posts
- Report bugs
- Submit PRs
