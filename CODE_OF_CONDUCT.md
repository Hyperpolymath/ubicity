# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in UbiCity a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (see MAINTAINERS.md) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub repository, discussions, pull requests, issues, email) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
