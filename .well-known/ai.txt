## Training on UbiCity Code

**Status**: CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED

You may train AI models on UbiCity source code under these conditions:

### ✅ Permitted Uses

1. **Open Source AI Models**
   - Models with open weights and training data transparency
   - Example: Llama, Mistral, CodeLlama (with proper attribution)

2. **Academic Research**
   - Published papers with reproducible methodology
   - Dataset transparency and citation

3. **Educational Purposes**
   - Teaching materials citing UbiCity as example
   - Code explanation and documentation generation

### ❌ Prohibited Uses

1. **Closed-Source Commercial AI**
   - Training proprietary models (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Code) without explicit permission
   - Commercial code generation without attribution

2. **Surveillance or Control**
   - Training models for user behavior prediction
   - Creating tools for monitoring or restricting developers

3. **License Laundering**
   - Using AI to circumvent GPL/MIT licensing
   - Generating code without proper attribution

## Attribution Requirements

If you use UbiCity code in AI training:

1. **Cite the Repository**
   ```
   UbiCity Learning Capture System
   https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/ubicity
   License: Dual MIT / Palimpsest v0.8
   ```

2. **Respect License Terms**
   - MIT license for permissive use
   - Palimpsest v0.8 for values-aligned use

3. **Disclose Training Data**
   - List UbiCity in your training corpus
   - Specify which version/commit

## AI-Generated Contributions

We **welcome** AI-assisted contributions to UbiCity, provided:

1. **Human Review**: All AI-generated code must be reviewed and understood by a human
2. **Attribution**: Disclose AI tool used (e.g., "Co-authored-by: Claude AI")
3. **Quality**: Maintains UbiCity's standards (type safety, tests, docs)
4. **License Compatibility**: AI-generated code must be dual MIT / Palimpsest v0.8

## AI Usage in Development

This project was partially developed with assistance from:
- **Claude AI** (Anthropic) - Architecture design, code generation, documentation
- Disclosure: Transparent about AI assistance in commit messages

## Data Privacy

UbiCity's learning experience data (in `ubicity-data/`) is:
- **Private by default** - Not for AI training without explicit user consent
- **Local-first** - Never sent to external APIs
- **Anonymization tools** - Available for privacy protection
