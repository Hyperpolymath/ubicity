## Choosing a License

### Use MIT if:
- You need OSI-approved license for corporate compliance
- You want maximum legal clarity
- You're building commercial products
- You don't care about values alignment

### Use Palimpsest if:
- You share UbiCity's values
- You want to prevent harmful use
- You're building community-driven projects
- You're willing to experiment with new licensing models

**You cannot use BOTH simultaneously**. Pick one.
