## Rollback Procedure

If critical bug discovered post-release:

1. **Assessment** (< 1 hour)
   - Severity: Does it cause data loss/corruption?
   - Impact: How many users affected?

2. **Decision** (maintainers consensus)
   - Option A: Hotfix patch (preferred)
   - Option B: Rollback release (nuclear option)

3. **Hotfix Process** (< 24 hours)
   - Create `hotfix/vX.Y.Z+1` branch
   - Fix bug
   - Fast-track testing
   - Release immediately

4. **Rollback Process** (last resort)
   - Yank release from package managers
   - Update docs: "vX.Y.Z deprecated, use vX.Y.Z-1"
   - Post-mortem analysis

---

## Metrics & Monitoring
